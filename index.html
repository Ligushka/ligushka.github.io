        The Tone Unknown. What is it? It could never be said. 
        What we do know is that for seven glorious years, six line-ups, 
        four studio recordings and hundreds of live shows, The Tone Unknown 
        rocked Gainesville, Florida with its unique brand of high energy, 
        fat grooved original music.

        This web site has been built so that the music (and some of the 
        history we can actually remember) won't be lost. As always, it's about 
        the music. Most of the original recordings are on cassette tape, 
        and therefore bound for the trash bin. By digitizing and posting 
        the music on the web, we hope that the tunes will be preserved for 
        band and fans alike, and maybe even reach a few new ears. You can 
        download <strong>all</strong> of the songs the Tone recorded in high quality 
        MP3 format and thereby burn your own CDs -- and also share them. 
        Additionally, we there are a few live versions of the songs and 
        tunes that were never recorded. We plan to digitize more, so stay 
        tuned. If you have any decent quality live tapes please <a href="mailto:robis@robis.org">let 
        us know</a>.

        What else: You'll also find a history of the band with the various 
        line-ups, incomplete and inaccurate, but we tried. We've got some 
        old and embarrassing photos here and finally, a liner notes of the 
        albums we recorded, with the original art work and some extra info 
        from the band. If you have any suggestions or requests of stuff 
        that you would like to see or hear, please <a href="mailto:robis@robis.org">
        email us</a>. Also, check out our entry on
