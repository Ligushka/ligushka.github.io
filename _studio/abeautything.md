The CD. It actually happened. Trent and Greg left the band and we kept going. Some felt it wasn't the Tone without horns, but Henry, Jorge and Rob had written the vast majority of the songs, and that's what we thought made it the Tone. It definitely wasn't the same. But the change was necessary, and we ended up with a great album and some great songs because we kept going.

Recording this one was a lot of fun (except for that day Rob yelled at Henry) and it was great to finally record these songs. We actually had time to do the mixdown, and it shows. This is by far the best sounding recording we ever did, both in terms of mix, overall sound quality of the instruments, and recording. Bob McPeek did a great job at engineering, and even played a little guitar.

The art for the CD was supplied by Terry Towery. This is the back of the booklet -- Terry was toys and miniatures taken out of context (and sometimes focus) with unexpected perspectives. He was generous enough to let us use a bunch of his artwork as backgrounds for the entire booklet. Terry has been a professor in NYC since around 1989, when he left G-ville with his MFA and camera.

Soundgarden ended up ripping us off ;-) on the art thing -- if you check out the booklet of <em>Superunknown</em>, you'll see they used the same idea, except they had money for color. Anyway, our photography was more interesting!

How many times were the Twin Towers incidently or accidentally photographed?
