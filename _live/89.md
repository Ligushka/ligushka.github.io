**Matthew** says about this recording:

> This cassette tape was received in a box of used cassettes "buschman31" sent over for all of $4. The tapes were just going to be used to record over, but finding this tape was a pleasant surprise.

> The exact date of the concert is unknown, but based on some information from the defunct website [The Gainesville Band Family Tree](https://web.archive.org/web/20050312212145/http://www.gainesvillebandfamilytree.com/article.php?TYPE=band&ID=537), it's pretty early in the band's history since the vocalist Henry says "we donâ€™t need no drum machine, we got Gerald on the scene" at the start of track 6 and the website indicates that Gerald was the drummer early on. I've made contact with both Henry and Greg from the band and they think this is from some time in 1989.

> This is a soundboard recording, so the sound quality is pretty good. There's very little hiss, so this might be a master tape or a very low generation copy. Unfortunately, there is music on only the A-side of the tape, the B-side is completely blank; either the concert concluded, or the tape was forgotten about and never flipped to continue recording.

> Thanks to "buschman31" on the Ars Technica forum who sold me the box of tapes containing this tape.
