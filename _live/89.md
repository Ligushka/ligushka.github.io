**Matthew** says about this recording:

> I got this tape in a box of used cassettes back in 2015. The exact date of the concert is unknown but based on some information from the defunct website [The Gainesville Band Family Tree](https://web.archive.org/web/20050312212145/http://www.gainesvillebandfamilytree.com/article.php?TYPE=band&ID=537), it's pretty early on since Henry says "we don't need no drum machine, we got Gerald on the scene" at the start of track 6. Both Henry and Greg think this is from some time in 1989. This is a soundboard recording, so the sound quality is pretty good.
