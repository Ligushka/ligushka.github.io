**Rob Is** remembers:

> This sounds like one of those very hot shows at the Hardback. It must have been in the big room in the back, I'm guessin' it was '92 not '91. A very rowdy and rocking crowd to go along with a balls to the wall performance -- the Tone at top form. The sound quality can't compare to the Yanni's tapes, but it's not bad for a live tape with a lot of room sound.
